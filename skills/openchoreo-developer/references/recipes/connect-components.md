# Connect components (endpoint dependencies)

Wire one Component to another's endpoint so OpenChoreo injects the resolved service address as an env var. Uses `spec.dependencies.endpoints[]` on the consuming Workload.

## When to use

- One component needs to call another component's endpoint
- The user is hardcoding hostnames or guessing service DNS — replace with a dependency
- Cross-project dependencies (e.g. an app calling a shared `auth-service` in a `platform-services` project)
- For attaching plain env vars or secrets unrelated to other components, use `recipes/configure-workload.md` / `recipes/manage-secrets.md`

## Prerequisites

> **The dependency entry's `visibility` is constrained to `project` or `namespace` only.** The API rejects `internal` and `external` on `dependencies.endpoints[*].visibility` — those two levels exist for *target endpoint declarations* (ingress) and for non-dependency consumers, not for service-to-service dependency wiring. **Cross-namespace dependencies are not supported** via this mechanism; if you need one, escalate to `openchoreo-platform-engineer` (a gateway / network-policy approach).

> **Default `visibility: project`.** Same-project, same-environment is the baseline — that's what a Project's Cell is for, and it does not require any gateway routing. Pick `namespace` only when the consumer and target are actually in different projects of the same namespace. Confirm both components' projects via `get_component` before deciding.

1. Both Components exist and the **target's endpoint visibility is broad enough** for the consumer. Pick the dependency entry's `visibility` field from this table:

| Consumer / target relationship | Set `visibility:` to | Target endpoint must declare at least |
|---|---|---|
| same project + same environment | `project` (default) | `project` (implicit on every endpoint) |
| different project, same namespace | `namespace` | `namespace` |
| different namespace | _not supported_ | — |

2. Visibility on the target endpoint is a *list*, so a target can have e.g. `[namespace, external]` and serve both same-project and cross-project consumers. The four target-side visibility levels are `project`, `namespace`, `internal`, `external`. The two dependency-side options are a strict subset (`project`, `namespace`).

3. **The dependency entry uses `name:` (the target endpoint name on the dependency component), not `endpoint:`.** The pre-v1.0.0 `endpoint:` field is gone. Discover the target's endpoint names via `get_workload` first.

To inspect a target's endpoint visibility:

```
get_workload
  namespace_name: default
  workload_name: <target>-workload
```

## Recipe

### 1. Read the consuming Workload

```
get_workload
  namespace_name: default
  workload_name: frontend-workload
```

### 2. Add `dependencies.endpoints[]` and update

Send the full updated `workload_spec` with a new `dependencies` block:

```
update_workload
  namespace_name: default
  workload_name: frontend-workload
  workload_spec:
    owner: {projectName: default, componentName: frontend}
    container: {...}                  # unchanged from the read
    endpoints: {...}                  # unchanged from the read
    dependencies:
      endpoints:
        - component: user-service     # target component name
          name: http                  # target endpoint name (NOT "endpoint")
          visibility: project
          envBindings:
            address: USER_SERVICE_URL
```

OpenChoreo injects `USER_SERVICE_URL` (and any other env vars in `envBindings`) into the consumer's container at runtime. The dependency makes a new ComponentRelease.

### 3. Verify after redeploy

Once the redeploy is `Ready`, fetch runtime logs and confirm the env var resolves. Find the pod name first, then read its container logs:

```
get_resource_events
  namespace_name: default
  release_binding_name: frontend-development
  group: ""
  version: v1
  kind: Pod
  resource_name: frontend            # the workload's pod prefix; events surface concrete pod names

get_resource_logs
  namespace_name: default
  release_binding_name: frontend-development
  pod_name: <pod from events above>
```

Look for `USER_SERVICE_URL` in startup logs or grep against the printed env. For deeper inspection, see `recipes/inspect-and-debug.md`.

## Patterns

### Same-project dependency

```yaml
dependencies:
  endpoints:
    - component: user-service
      name: http
      visibility: project              # implicit default; same project, same env
      envBindings:
        address: USER_SERVICE_URL
```

### Cross-project dependency

```yaml
dependencies:
  endpoints:
    - component: shared-auth-service
      name: http
      visibility: namespace            # broader than project
      project: platform-services       # required when target is in a different project
      envBindings:
        address: AUTH_SERVICE_URL
        host: AUTH_SERVICE_HOST
        port: AUTH_SERVICE_PORT
```

The target's `endpoints.http.visibility` must include `namespace` (or broader).

### Multiple dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  endpoints:
    - component: user-service
      name: http
      visibility: project
      envBindings:
        address: USER_SERVICE_URL
    - component: notification-service
      name: grpc
      visibility: project
      envBindings:
        address: NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_ADDR
    - component: analytics-api
      name: http
      visibility: namespace
      project: analytics
      envBindings:
        address: ANALYTICS_API_URL
        basePath: ANALYTICS_API_BASE_PATH
```

### SPA frontend with HTTP + Websocket backends (same project)

A common multi-backend pattern: a browser-side SPA in the same project as a REST backend and a Websocket backend. The frontend declares both as same-project dependencies; the platform handles Websocket protocol upgrade natively when the target endpoint `type` is `Websocket`. **Don't** add a custom reverse-proxy or protocol-upgrade configuration (nginx, Caddy, Envoy sidecar, etc.) — set the target's endpoint type and let OpenChoreo route it.

Target backends' workload spec (excerpt):

```yaml
endpoints:
  api:
    type: HTTP
    port: 8080
    visibility: [project, external]   # external so the browser can reach it
  ws:
    type: Websocket
    port: 8081
    visibility: [project, external]
```

Frontend's workload spec (excerpt):

```yaml
dependencies:
  endpoints:
    - component: document-svc
      name: api
      visibility: project              # default — same-project link
      envBindings:
        address: DOCUMENT_API_URL
    - component: collab-svc
      name: ws
      visibility: project
      envBindings:
        address: COLLAB_WS_URL
```

For a browser-side SPA, the runtime URLs the browser actually fetches must be the **external** addresses from `get_release_binding` → `endpoints[*].externalURLs`, served via a mounted `config.json` (use `https://` and `wss://` schemes). The `dependencies.endpoints[]` declaration is still required — it makes the connection visible in the cell topology and tells the platform which components talk to which. See `recipes/configure-workload.md` for the file-mount pattern. Reference samples: `samples/from-image/echo-websocket-service/` and the platform docs for protocol-upgrade behaviour.

## envBindings keys

Each binding takes one or more of:

| Key | Injects | Example value |
|---|---|---|
| `address` | full address | `http://user-service.default.svc.cluster.local:9090/api` |
| `host` | hostname only | `user-service.default.svc.cluster.local` |
| `port` | port number only | `9090` |
| `basePath` | base path only (HTTP only) | `/api` |

The format of `address` depends on the endpoint type:

- `HTTP` / `GraphQL`: `http://host:port/basePath`
- `Websocket`: `ws://host:port/basePath` (in-cluster scheme; for browser-facing access, use the external `wss://` URL from `get_release_binding` → `endpoints[*].externalURLs`, not this injected value)
- `gRPC` / `TCP` / `UDP`: `host:port` (no scheme, no path)

If the target endpoint has no `basePath`, `address` ends at `host:port` with no trailing slash.

The right side of each `envBindings` entry is the env var name in the consumer.

> **When the consumer needs a value `envBindings` can't give you directly** (a connection-string DSN, a compound URL, anything stitched from multiple pieces or in a non-standard scheme), two options:
>
> - **Per-env override on the consumer's ReleaseBinding** — deploy the dep first, read its live endpoint via `get_release_binding` → `status.endpoints[*].serviceURL.host` and `.port`, compose the value the consumer needs, set it as a literal in `workloadOverrides.env`. Each env binding carries its own value; same `ComponentRelease` promotes cleanly. See [`./override-per-environment.md`](./override-per-environment.md).
> - **Stitch in app code** — inject `host`, `port` etc. as separate env vars via `envBindings`; the app builds the DSN at startup. No platform-side override needed; requires a small code change.
>
> Embedded credentials should still come from a `SecretReference` via `valueFrom.secretKeyRef` in either of the above.

## Gotchas

- **Dependencies live at `spec.dependencies.endpoints[]`, not flat `spec.dependencies[]` or `spec.connections[]`.** The pre-v1.0.0 flat shape is gone. Each entry uses `name` for the target endpoint name — not `endpoint`.
- **`update_workload` sends the full spec** — read first, append the dependency, send back. See `recipes/configure-workload.md` for the same gotcha.
- **Visibility mismatch is silent until reconcile.** `update_workload` accepts a dependency whose target visibility is too narrow, but the ReleaseBinding fails to bind. Check `status.conditions` on the ReleaseBinding for the actual error.
- **Cross-project dependencies require both `visibility: namespace` and `project: <target-project>`.** Missing `project` defaults to the same project — the binding fails with "endpoint not found" because the controller looks in the wrong project.
- **Dependency entry's `visibility` is `project` or `namespace` only.** The API rejects `internal` and `external` here. Cross-namespace dependencies are not supported via this mechanism — escalate to PE for a gateway-based approach.
- **Consumer's visibility request must be ≤ what the target declares.** Asking for `namespace` against a target whose endpoint visibility is `[project]` fails reconciliation. Either lower the consumer's visibility (only `project` works for a project-only target) or have the target add `namespace` to its endpoint visibility list.
- **Max 50 endpoint dependencies per Workload.** A consumer pulling from more than 50 components is a design smell — split it.
- **Connection refused after deploy?** Confirm the target's endpoint visibility list includes the level the consumer is asking for. Most "it deployed but can't connect" issues trace to this.
- **The injected `address` already includes the scheme (HTTP/WS).** Don't prepend `http://` in the consumer's code when using `address`. If you need just the host, use `envBindings.host` instead.
- **Don't stitch values via `$(VAR)` substitution against dependency-injected env vars.** Doesn't reliably work; the placeholder ends up verbatim in the running container.
