# Build from source

Build a container image from a Git repository using a CI workflow, then deploy it as a Component. The workflow clones the repo, runs the configured builder (Dockerfile / buildpacks / Ballerina), pushes the image, and auto-generates a Workload from the build output.

## When to use

- The user wants OpenChoreo to build their image from source
- The repo has a Dockerfile, buildpack-compatible source, or Ballerina code
- For deploying an already-built image, see `recipes/deploy-prebuilt-image.md` instead

## Prerequisites

1. The control-plane MCP server is configured and reachable (`list_namespaces` returns).
2. A Project exists (see [Create a Project](deploy-prebuilt-image.md#variant-create-a-project)).
3. The repo URL, branch, and the path to the app inside the repo (`appPath`) are known.
4. The ClusterComponentType you'll use lists the workflow you want in `allowedWorkflows`. Discover with `list_cluster_component_types`, then `get_cluster_component_type` to read `allowedWorkflows`.

## Available builders

| ClusterWorkflow name | Builder | Builder-specific parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `dockerfile-builder` | Dockerfile / Containerfile | `docker.context`, `docker.filePath` |
| `gcp-buildpacks-builder` | Google Cloud buildpacks (Go, Java, Node, Python, .NET) | `buildEnv` (optional) |
| `paketo-buildpacks-builder` | Paketo buildpacks (Java, Node, Python, Go, .NET, Ruby, PHP) | `buildEnv` (optional) |
| `ballerina-buildpack-builder` | Ballerina | `buildEnv` (optional) |

All workflows share `repository.url`, `repository.revision.branch`, `repository.revision.commit` (optional), `repository.appPath`, and `repository.secretRef` (for private repos).

## Recipe

### 1. Pick a workflow and inspect its schema

```
list_cluster_workflows
```

Pick one, then read the parameter schema so you know what fields to pass:

```
get_cluster_workflow_schema
  cwf_name: dockerfile-builder
```

### 2. Create the Component with `workflow` set

```
create_component
  namespace_name: default
  project_name: default
  name: greeting-service
  component_type: deployment/service
  auto_deploy: true
  workflow:
    kind: ClusterWorkflow
    name: dockerfile-builder
    parameters:
      repository:
        url: https://github.com/openchoreo/sample-workloads
        revision:
          branch: main
        appPath: /service-go-greeter
      docker:
        context: /service-go-greeter
        filePath: /service-go-greeter/Dockerfile
```

**Do not call `create_workload`.** Source-build auto-generates `{component}-workload` from the build output (and from `workload.yaml` in the repo, if present).

### 3. (Optional) Add `workload.yaml` to the repo

Put a `workload.yaml` at the root of `appPath` to declare endpoints, env vars, config files, and dependencies. Without it, the generated Workload only has `container.image` set — no endpoints, no env, nothing.

Copy `assets/workload-descriptor.yaml` into the repo at `<appPath>/workload.yaml` and edit. Schema fields:

- `endpoints[]` — `name`, `port`, `type` (HTTP/gRPC/etc), `visibility[]`, `basePath`, `schemaFile`
- `configurations.env[]` — literal `value` or `valueFrom.secretKeyRef`
- `configurations.files[]` — `mountPath` plus literal `value` or `valueFrom.path` (file in the repo) or `valueFrom.secretKeyRef`
- `dependencies.endpoints[]` — `component`, `name`, `visibility`, `envBindings`

Commit and push before triggering the build — the build reads the descriptor at build time.

### 4. Trigger a build

```
trigger_workflow_run
  namespace_name: default
  project_name: default
  component_name: greeting-service
  commit: <optional commit SHA — defaults to HEAD of the configured branch>
```

This uses the workflow already configured on the Component. For a one-off build with different parameters, `create_workflow_run` lets you supply a `parameters` object directly.

### 5. Monitor the build

```
list_workflow_runs
  namespace_name: default
  project_name: default
  component_name: greeting-service
```

Pick the latest run name from the list, then:

```
get_workflow_run
  namespace_name: default
  run_name: <run name>
```

Check `status.conditions` for `WorkflowSucceeded` / `WorkflowFailed`, and `status.tasks[]` for per-step phase (`Pending`, `Running`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Skipped`, `Error`). Standard task names: `checkout-source`, `containerfile-build` (or builder-specific), `publish-image`, `generate-workload-cr`.

For build logs: tail `get_workflow_run_logs` while the run is in progress (optionally filter by `task`, optionally bound with `since_seconds`). Pair it with `get_workflow_run_events` if a task pod is stuck pending or failed to start. For *completed* failed runs, the live-log endpoint returns nothing — escalate to PE for `kubectl logs --previous` against the Argo pod, or rely on `get_workflow_run.status.conditions` and per-task phase to localize the failure.

### 6. Verify the deploy

After `WorkflowSucceeded`, the generated Workload triggers an auto-deploy (because `auto_deploy: true` on the Component). Verify with the same flow as BYOI:

```
get_component
list_release_bindings
get_release_binding
get_resource_events / get_resource_logs    # pod-level events and runtime logs once Ready
```

See `recipes/inspect-and-debug.md` for deeper inspection.

## Variant: auto-build on push

Add `autoBuild: true` to the Component. With both `autoBuild: true` and `autoDeploy: true`, every push to the configured branch (and within the configured `appPath`) builds and deploys automatically.

```yaml
spec:
  autoBuild: true
  autoDeploy: true
  workflow:
    parameters:
      repository:
        url: https://github.com/<org>/<repo>
        revision:
          branch: main
        appPath: /service
```

What triggers a build:
1. Push URL matches `repository.url`
2. Branch matches `repository.revision.branch`
3. The push includes a change inside `appPath`

If all three match, the platform creates a WorkflowRun automatically with the commit SHA.

> **PE setup required.** Auto-build needs a webhook receiver and webhook secret configured in the platform. If pushes don't trigger builds, escalate to `openchoreo-platform-engineer` to verify the webhook setup.

## When you're in the source repo of the component

If the agent is operating inside the git repo for this component (not just pointing at an external Git URL), the iteration loop becomes tighter — the agent can write `workload.yaml`, coordinate commits/pushes/PRs, and trigger builds against the right commit. **Always coordinate with the user before any git action — confirm before staging, before pushing, before opening a PR.**

### First-time setup: where does the workload spec live?

Two options for source-build, with tradeoffs covered in [`../getting-started.md`](../getting-started.md) §6 — surface the choice to the user, don't pick silently:

- **Committed `workload.yaml`** in the source repo. Spec is source-controlled. Every rebuild does a full `PUT` from the descriptor — endpoints, env, deps, files, image are all regenerated. MCP edits between rebuilds are overwritten.
- **`update_workload` via MCP** against the auto-generated `{component}-workload`. Spec lives only on the cluster. Fast iteration; **MCP edits persist across rebuilds** because the build only patches `container.image` when no descriptor is in the repo. Adding a `workload.yaml` later is a one-way migration and clobbers any MCP-applied state.

If the user picks committed `workload.yaml`:

1. Compose the descriptor (use [`../../assets/workload-descriptor.yaml`](../../assets/workload-descriptor.yaml) as a starting point). Confirm endpoints, dependencies, env vars, file mounts with the user.
2. Stage and commit with a clear message ("Add OpenChoreo workload descriptor"). Show the diff before pushing.
3. Push to the branch the workflow watches (`repository.revision.branch`). If the user works on a PR-only model, push the branch and open a PR via `gh pr create` — surface the PR URL and ask the user to merge before triggering a build, since the build will pull the merged commit.
4. Trigger the build with `trigger_workflow_run`, or rely on `autoBuild: true` if it's wired up. Use `get_workflow_run_logs` (live) and `get_workflow_run_events` to follow.

If the user picks MCP-edit:

1. Trigger the first build. With no `workload.yaml` in the repo, the platform creates a minimal `{component}-workload` — `container.image` set, everything else empty.
2. After build success, `update_workload` against `{component}-workload` to add endpoints, dependencies, env vars, file mounts. **Full-spec replacement**: `get_workload` first, modify, write back. These edits persist; subsequent rebuilds will only update the image tag.
3. Note in `CLAUDE.md` that this component is on the MCP-edit path. Adding a `workload.yaml` to the repo later is a *one-way migration* — the next rebuild will full-PUT from the descriptor and overwrite the live MCP-edited spec. To migrate cleanly: dump current `get_workload` output, transform into descriptor shape, commit, rebuild.

### Iteration loop: code change → rebuild → redeploy

To roll a code change to OpenChoreo:

1. Stage / commit / push the change (with explicit user approval per step). For a PR-based flow, push the branch, open the PR, and wait for the user to merge — surface the PR URL clearly. Don't auto-merge.
2. After the change is on the watched branch: if `autoBuild: true` is configured and the webhook is healthy, the push triggers a build automatically. Otherwise call `trigger_workflow_run` against the merged commit (pin via the `commit` parameter for reproducibility).
3. Tail the build with `get_workflow_run_logs`; pair with `get_workflow_run_events` if a task pod is stuck.
4. On success a new ComponentRelease appears. With `autoDeploy: true`, the first env redeploys automatically; for downstream envs, follow [`./deploy-and-promote.md`](./deploy-and-promote.md).

Persist the iteration command (e.g. "to redeploy: edit code, then ask the agent to push to `main` and trigger the build") in `CLAUDE.md` so the user's next session is one prompt instead of a Q&A loop.

## Gotchas

- **Source-build vs BYOI is determined by `spec.workflow`.** Set it → source build (and the platform creates the Workload for you). Omit it → BYOI (you must create the Workload yourself).
- **For source-build, never call `create_workload` (MCP) or write a Workload CR.** The Workload is auto-generated as `{component}-workload` from the build output and the optional in-repo `workload.yaml`. Use `update_workload` only after a successful build, when the repo has no `workload.yaml` and you need to enrich the auto-generated minimal Workload.
- **`workload.yaml` must live at the root of `appPath`**, not at the repo root (unless `appPath` is `/`). Build-time read; commits after the build don't affect already-built releases.
- **Workflow must be in the ComponentType's `allowedWorkflows`.** If `create_component` fails with `ComponentValidationFailed`, the chosen workflow isn't allowed by the ComponentType — pick a different workflow or ask PE to extend `allowedWorkflows`.
- **WorkflowRuns are imperative, not declarative.** Each one starts a build. Do not commit WorkflowRun YAML to a GitOps repo — it'll trigger duplicate builds on every reconcile.
- **Required labels on a manual WorkflowRun YAML:** `openchoreo.dev/project` and `openchoreo.dev/component`. Missing them fails with `ComponentValidationFailed`. (Not an issue when using `trigger_workflow_run` — it sets the labels for you.)
- **Validation failures are permanent.** `ComponentValidationFailed` won't auto-retry — fix the spec and trigger a new run. `WorkflowPlaneNotFound` is transient and retried automatically.
- **Buildah builds fail on multi-platform Dockerfiles.** Third-party Dockerfiles using `ARG BUILDPLATFORM` typically exit 125 with a `BUILDPLATFORM` error. For third-party apps, prefer BYOI — see `recipes/deploy-prebuilt-image.md`.
- **Auto-build needs PE-side webhook setup.** Setting `autoBuild: true` alone isn't enough — pushes won't trigger builds without the webhook receiver. Escalate if it isn't working.
- **`trigger_workflow_run` vs `create_workflow_run`.** `trigger_workflow_run` starts a build using the component's configured workflow (optional `commit` SHA pins a revision). `create_workflow_run` creates a standalone run by workflow name with explicit parameters — use that for workflows that aren't tied to a component.
- **Workflow runs can lag.** A just-triggered run may briefly show no runs. Call `list_workflow_runs` after a moment, then verify with `get_component`.
